== Version Control System

The rules defined in this document refer to Git.

=== Concepts
[[vcs:CurrentBranch]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.The currently checked-out local branch is labeled with `Current`.
----
MATCH
  (repository:Repository)-[:HAS_BRANCH]->(branch:Git:Branch)
WHERE
  branch.name starts with "heads/"
MATCH
  (repository)-[:HAS_HEAD]->(head:Git:Commit),
  (branch)-[:HAS_HEAD]->(branchHead:Git:Commit),
   p=shortestPath((branchHead)-[:HAS_PARENT*0..]->(head))
SET
  branch:Current
RETURN
  branch.name as CurrentBranch, length(p) as Offset
----

[[vcs:GitToJavaConnection]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Creates a relationship between a changed File and the Java Type.
----
MATCH (c:Git:Change)--(g:Git:File), (t:Java:Type)
WITH g, t, c, "^.*" + REPLACE(t.fileName, ".class", ".java") + "$" as regexPath
WHERE g.relativePath =~ regexPath
CREATE UNIQUE
    (t)-[change:HAS_CHANGE]->(c)
RETURN COUNT(change) as Changes
----


=== Constraints

[[vcs:BranchesMustBeSynchronized]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint]
.The branches "violations" and "jqa-remote" must include the latest commit (HEAD) of "master" (i.e. merges are required).
----
MATCH
  (master:Branch),
  (branch:Branch)
WHERE
  master.name = "heads/master"
  and branch.name in [
    "heads/jqa-violations",
    "heads/jqa-remote",
    "heads/jqa-testimpactanalysis"
  ]
WITH
  master, branch
MATCH
  (master)-[:HAS_HEAD]->(masterHead:Commit),
  (branch)-[:HAS_HEAD]->(branchHead:Commit)
WHERE
  branchHead <> masterHead
OPTIONAL MATCH
  p=shortestPath((branchHead)-[:HAS_PARENT*]->(masterHead))
WITH
  master, branch, p
WHERE
  p is null
RETURN
  branch.name as OutdatedBranch
