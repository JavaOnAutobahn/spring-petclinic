== Code Analysis

=== Concepts

[[codeanalysis:FindBugsCodeConnection]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Creates a relationship HAS_BUG between CLASS labeled nodes and BUGINSTANCE labeled nodes with same FQN.
----
MATCH
    (c:Class), (s:SourceLine)--(b:BugInstance)
WHERE
    c.fqn=s.fqn
CREATE UNIQUE
    (c)-[:HAS_BUG]->(b)
RETURN
    count(b) as FindBugsInstances
----


[[codeanalysis:TypeLastLineNumber]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Derives the last line number of a type from a method as proxy for lines of code.
----
MATCH
    (t:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(m:Method)
WITH t, MAX(m.lastLineNumber) as lastMethodLineNumber
SET
    t.lastMethodLineNumber = lastMethodLineNumber
RETURN
    count(t) as TypesProvidedWithLastLineNumber
----

=== Efforts
This list shows the overall efforts that were invested in the software measured by the developers's contributions.
It also shows the latest data from production use.

=== Additional Findings
[[codeanalysis:AdditionalFindingsRecursive]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Lists all recursive calls to the database. Is this a bug or a feature?
----
MATCH (c:Class)-[:DECLARES]->(m:Method),
(m)-[:INVOKES]->(m),
(m)-[i:INVOKES]->(m2:Method),
(m2)<-[:DECLARES]-(dbClass)
WHERE dbClass.name contains("Database")
RETURN c.name, m.name, i.lineNumber, m2.name, dbClass.name
