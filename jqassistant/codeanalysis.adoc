[[codeanalysis:FindBugsCodeConnection]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Creates a relationship HAS_BUG between CLASS labeled nodes and BUGINSTANCE labeled nodes with same FQN.
----
MATCH
    (c:Class), (s:SourceLine)--(b:BugInstance)
WHERE
    c.fqn=s.fqn
CREATE UNIQUE
    (c)-[:HAS_BUG]->(b)
RETURN
    count(b) as FindBugsInstances
----


[[codeanalysis:TypeLastLineNumber]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Derives the last line number of a type from a method as proxy for lines of code.
----
MATCH
    (t:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(m:Method)
WITH t, MAX(m.lastLineNumber) as lastMethodLineNumber
SET
    t.lastMethodLineNumber = lastMethodLineNumber
RETURN
    count(t) as TypesProvidedWithLastLineNumber
